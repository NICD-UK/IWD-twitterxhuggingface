1,"Absolutely 💔 not being able to get a ticket for any of the 9 #Eurovision shows. 
Heartbroken. Been watching the contest since 1995 and this was the first chance I could go. 
Maybe I’ll just visit Liverpool during #Eurovision week and live in the atmosphere outside. 😢😢😢"
2,I cannot believe I’m going to the semi final of Eurovision - what the SHIT https://t.co/f2IofWObIy
3,"I knew the scramble for Eurovision tickets would be wild and highly entertaining but OMG has it delivered 😂 for those who got tickets - congratulations! Those who didn't, I'm sorry you are disappointed but Liverpool will still have plenty of events you can attend 😁"

9,kay not going to eurovision but still going to liverpool :)
10,RIP to my Eurovision ticket dreams.
11,@caemson78 @Eurovision And the sad thing is you risk getting lots of empty seats if people refuse to pay the touters £11k for a single ticket.
12,"Didn't manage to get Eurovision tickets?

Come and watch it at ours instead

https://t.co/SMTEAqEuP2 https://t.co/Z5HseEwWJc"

14,@omgcocaptains Eurovision tickets? I was behind 2000+ people when they sold out 34 mins in
15,Well that was a bit of #Eurovision excitement for today!
16,@KatieW95 @nardysays @TicketmasterUK @Ticketmaster @Eurovision They're still available on the semi final 2 - evening preview show
17,"@Rylan @Eurovision If we have £10,000 to get them of Viagogo where they have all ended up! What an absolute disgrace!"
18,Also I listened to Birdy’s new single last night and got strong Eurovision vibes. I now see she is favourite to represent the UK at Eurovision. That would make up for missing tickets.
19,Failed at getting Eurovision tickets. https://t.co/01ooYfEUeN
20,Tickets for the Eurovision grand final have already sold out - 12 minutes after booking opened

36,@jessssicab_x @Eurovision I’m not paying £800 for a rehearsal of a semi final. It lets you get to the lobby then tells you nothing is available

39,"Well that's another Eurovision in front of the TV for me this year. 7 years now I've tried to get tickets and been unsuccessful every single time. I really don't know what more I could have done. Just the luck of the draw. 

Hope you all have a wonderful time in Liverpool"
40,"@JamesMartinTVR For the record, I didn’t attempt to get any tickets. I enjoy Eurovision as a whole and have watched the event for years, the proper watch party happens on the final for myself with friends and family. Fair weather fans seems a bit of an unprovoked jab."

53,"@Rylan @Eurovision @Ticketmaster Background to above tweet. So been sitting here since 11 o’clock waiting for queue to open. As soon as it did, system collapsed! Couldn’t get in queue till 5 past 12. At 12.40 when I got back in, there wasn’t a ticket in sight. Farce!!!😡"

69,I know I’ve been to the Liverpool arena already but I didn’t realise how small it is. Half the size of Lisbon’s and smaller than Malmö. Wish I remembered Copenhagen warehouse capacity. #Eurovision

74,"@BigYeti019 @TomPatTweets @Eurovision The fairest solution would have been a ballot. 

I was really disappointed to see it was a general sale through ticketmaster because you know it’s near on impossible vs touts"

- Limits on ticket purchases must remain in place
- Don't fucking use Ticketmaster"
